 ## Properties Mini-exercise, Lightbulb
 In the lightbulb example, the bulb goes back to a successful setting if the current gets too high. In real life, that wouldn't work. The bulb would burn out! Rewrite the structure so that the bulb turns off before the current burns it out. You'll need to use the `willSet` observer for this. This observer gets called *before* the value is changed. The value that is about to be set is available in the constant `newValue`. Keep in mind that you cannot change this `newValue`, and it will still be set, so you'll have to do more than just add a `willSet` observer. :]
